# Technologies Used:

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
PgAdmin is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.
We intent to use AWS-PgAdmin so individuals can access to it on their own.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier.
We will be using linear degression in the SciKitLearn library to create a mock model

## Dashboard
We will use tableau to implement an interactive dashboard.
