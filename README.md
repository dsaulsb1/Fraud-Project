# Fraud-or-Telecom
Repository for Group Project Segment 1

## Description of communication protocols:
We created a slack group messaging where it allows us to communicate with each other when needed. We also shared our email addresses to be able to add the appropriate team to the github reposository and having access to each other emails allow us to communicate when we do not have slack available.

# Technologies Used:

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
PgAdmin is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.
We intent to use AWS-PgAdmin so individuals can access to it on their own.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier.
We will be using linear degression in the SciKitLearn library to create a mock model

## Dashboard
We will use tableau to implement an interactive dashboard.
