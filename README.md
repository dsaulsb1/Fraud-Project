# Fraud-or-Telecom
Repository for Group Project Segment 1

## Description of this repo
This repo currently provides backup code for Olu's repo. Instead of using AWS, I simply have the data stored in a Postgres server, which I connect to in the Juypter notebook code. I then read in the data as a dataframe and print out the data labels (column names).
